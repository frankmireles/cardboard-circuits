# Project 001 Desk Lamp

## Overview
Our first project will be do design a desk lamp that changes it's colors by using one of the the sensors and LED's in our Circuit Playground.

First lets frame some main ideas for our project

- What is my lamp going to react to ( light, sound, movement, touch, buttons)
- What colors do I want to use and what is the meaning of each "state" for my Lamp
- What shape am I going to use
- What materials do I need to make my lamp.
- What makes my lamp special or different

## Activities

- Draw a sketch for your Lamp
- Draw a flow diagram for your lamp's functionality
- Program the circuit playground to react to the chosen input and test the output
- Make a prototype for your lamp, test different materials, put all the parts together.
- Test and observe
- Make changes in your code or/and your prototype
- Repeat the last two steps as needed.


## Example projects


## Take your project to the next level

Think about an extra added value for your lamp:
  - Think about making some Art with it
  - Project cool shadows or silhouettes
  - Make  it react to the user's "Mood"
  - Control it with your phone with a bluefruit
  - What could I do to my lamp that solves someones problem?

## Further Learning
- Research origame and unfolded shapes
- Research transparent, translucent and diffuse materials.
